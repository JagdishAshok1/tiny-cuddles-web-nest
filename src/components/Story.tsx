                When my twins, Lily and Sam, were born, I found myself searching endlessly for clothing that matched my values as a mother. I wanted pieces that were gentle on their delicate skin, kind to our planet, and beautiful enough to treasure in photos and memories.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Living far from family, with no nearby support system, those early days were filled with late-night research sessions about organic fabrics, safe dyes, and ethical production. I discovered that truly sustainable, beautifully crafted children's wear was harder to find than I'd imagined.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                So, with a heart full of love and a vision for something better, I started creating the clothes I wished existed. Each piece begins with the question: "Would I feel completely at peace putting this on my own child?"
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg font-medium text-sage-800">
                Today, Tiny Cuddles represents that same careful attention, that same mother's touch, in every thread. Because every child deserves to be wrapped in loveâ€”and every mother deserves to feel confident in her choices.
